Also known as blind search.\n- Breadth-first\n- Depth-first\n- Depth-limited\n- uniform-cost\n- Depth-first iterative deepening\n- Bidirectional\n\n### Bread-First Search (BFS)\n\n#### Charateristics\n- complete?\n    - yes, if $b$ is finite\n- Optimal?\n    - yes, if path cost is equal to depth\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n- Space complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n\n### Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)\nUniform-cost search is BFS with priority queue in function of cost. BFS is UCS with constant cost edges.\n\n#### Characteristics\n- complete?\n    - yes, given a finite number of nodes\n- Optimal?\n    - yes\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{\\frac{C^{*}}{\\epsilon + 1}}) \\geq O(b^{d + 1})$\n- Space complexity = $O(b^{\\frac{C^{*}}{\\epsilon + 1}}) \\geq O(b^{d + 1})$\n\n### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n\n#### Characteristics\n- Complete? \n    - yes, if $m$ is finite\n- Optimal?\n    - No\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{m})$\n- Space complexity = $O(bm)$\n\n### Depth-Limited Search (DLS)\nDepth-limited search is DFS with a depth bound of $l$.\n\n#### Characteristics\n- Complete? \n    - yes, $d <= l$\n- Optimal?\n    - No\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{l})$\n- Space complexity = $O(bl)$\n\n### Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)\nIterative deepening search is DLS, but if no solutions were found up to $l$, then the search depth is deepened by $l$ iteratively.\n\n#### Characteristics\n- Complete? \n    - yes, if $b$ is finite\n- Optimal?\n    - yes, if path cost is equal to depth\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{d})$\n- Space complexity = $O(bd)$\n\n### Informed Search\nInformed search strategies use information about the domain to head in the general direction of the goal node(s). Also known as heuristic search.\n- Hill climbing\n- Best-first\n- Greedy search\n- Beam, A, A*\n\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/School/ECE457A","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-05-25T05:05:31.962Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-25T07:25:32.538Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"5G7CS6s1L"}
