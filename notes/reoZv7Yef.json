Also known as heuristic search.\n- Hill climbing\n- Best-first\n- Greedy search\n- Beam, A, A*\n\n### Bread-First Search (BFS)\n\n#### Charateristics\n- complete?\n    - yes, if b is finite\n- Optimal?\n    - yes, if path cost is equal to depth.\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n- Space complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n\n### Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)\nUniform-cost search is BFS with priority queue in function of cost. BFS is UCS with constant cost edges.\n\n#### Characteristics\n- complete?\n    - yes, given a finite number of nodes.\n- Optimal?\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n- Space complexity = $O(b^{d + 1})$\n\n### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n- Complete? \n    - yes, if m is finite\n- Optimal?\n    - No\n- Time complexity = $O(b^{m})$\n- Space complexity = $O(bm)$","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/School/ECE457A","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-05-25T05:05:31.962Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-25T05:38:06.820Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"TE3rxnQh7"}
