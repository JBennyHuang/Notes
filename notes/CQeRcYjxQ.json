E.g. OMNET++, NS-2, Javasim, J-Sim, Glomosim, SensorSim, SENS, EmStar\n\n## Network Emulator\nto simulate the performance on the real hardware platform of WSN nodes.\n\n### OMNET++\nOMNeT++ is a simulator for discrete event network. It is object oriented and modular. Modules are connected using gates to form a compound module.\n\n![](image-kov3o6h0.png)\n\n#### Modules\n- The top level module is the system module.\n- System modiles can contain sub modules.\n- Sub modules can also contains sub modules.\n- Simple and compound modules are an instance of a module type.\n\n#### Messages, Gates, and Links\n- Module communicate with each other by exchanging message.\n- Messages can represent frames or packets.\n- Gates are the input and output interface between modules.\n- Two sub modules can be connected by links through gates.\n- Links are connections.\n- Connections support the following parameter\n    - Data rate, propagation delay, bit error rate, packet error rate, etc.\n\n#### Parameters \ncan be assigned in **NED files** or **omnetpp.ini** \n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/School/ECE659","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-05-19T04:56:41.405Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-19T22:05:31.886Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"ztHZogPq9"}
