For each $x$, both unilateral limits\n\n$$$\n\\lim_{t \\uparrow x} f(t) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow x^{-}} f(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad  \\lim_{t \\downarrow x} f(t) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow x^{+}} f(t)\n$$$\n\n2. For each $x$, $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only if \n\n$$$\n    \\lim_{t \\rightarrow x^{-}} f(t) = f(x) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow x^{+}} f(t)\n$$$\n\n3. The only possible kind of discontinuity of an increasing function is a jump.\n\n4. The set of discontinuities of $f$ is countable.\n\n5. Let $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ be two increasing functions and D a set that is dense in $(- \\infty, \\infty)$. Suppose that\n\n    $$$\n    \\forall x \\in D: f_{1}(x) = f_{2}(x)\n    $$$\n    \n    Then $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ have the same points of jump of the same size, and they coincide except possibly at some of these points of jump.\n\n6. if we put \n\n    $$$\n    \\forall x: \\tilde{f}(x) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow x^{+}} f(t)\n    $$$\n    \n    then $\\tilde{f}$ is increasing and right continuouse everywhere.\n\n7. Let $f$ be increasing on $D$, and define $\\tilde{f}$ on $(- \\infty, \\infty)$ as follows:\n\n    $$$\n     \\forall x: \\tilde{f}(x) = \\inf_{x < t \\in d} f(t)\n    $$$\n    \n    Then $\\tilde{f}$ is increasing and right continuous everywhere.","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/Textbooks/A Course in Probability Theory","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-05-14T21:09:54.502Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-15T22:03:17.486Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"Cup6LrMR_"}
